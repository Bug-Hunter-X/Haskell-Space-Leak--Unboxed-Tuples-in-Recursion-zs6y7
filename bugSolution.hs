The solution avoids creating new unboxed tuples in each recursion step.  Instead, it uses a single accumulating value, which greatly reduces memory usage during the computation.

```haskell
data MyData = MyData Int

process :: Int -> Int -> MyData
process 0 a = MyData a
process n a = process (n - 1) (a + 1)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = process 1000000 0
  print result
```
This revised code avoids the space leak by accumulating the result using a single integer argument, eliminating the continuous allocation of new unboxed tuples.
