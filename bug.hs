This Haskell code uses an unboxed tuple in a way that can lead to space leaks if not handled carefully.  The problem lies in the recursive function `process`. Each recursive call creates a new unboxed tuple `(a,b)`, which doesn't get garbage collected until the entire recursion completes.  If the recursion is deep or unbounded, this can consume a significant amount of memory.

```haskell
data MyData = MyData Int

process :: Int -> MyData -> MyData
process 0 _ = MyData 0
process n (MyData a) = let !(a',b) = (a+1, n) in process (n-1) (MyData a')

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = process 1000000 (MyData 0)
  print result
```
